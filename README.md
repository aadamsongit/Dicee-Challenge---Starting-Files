# Dicee-Challenge---Starting-Files

From Angela Yu's web development course: I did not write the code for the starting files on the HTML. I did create the JS and I modified some code I found for manipulating images through the DOM (as per the challenge), as well as showing who wins or whether it's a draw. I had a lot of fun with this challenge!
